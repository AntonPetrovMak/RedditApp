# RedditApp

## Test Assignment

We would like to have you complete the following code test so we can evaluate your iOS skills. Please place your code in a public Github repository and commit each step of your process so we can review it.
Your assignment is to create a simple Reddit client that shows the top entries from https://www.reddit.com/top

To do this please follow these guidelines:
- Assume the latest platform and use Swift
- Please refrain from using AFNetworking, instead use NSURLSession
- Support landscape
- Use storyboards

The app should be able to show data from each entry such as:
- Title (at its full length, so take this into account when sizing your cells)
- Author - Entry date, following a format like "X hours ago"â€‹
- A thumbnail for those who have a picture
- Number of comments

In addition, for those having a picture (besides the thumbnail), please allow the user to tap on the thumbnail to be sent to the full sized picture. You don't have to implement the IMGUR API, so just opening the URL would be OK.

Also include:
- Pagination and support for refresh
- App state-preservation/restoration
- Saving pictures in the picture gallery

## Note:
Please refrain from using external libraries (by way of using CocoaPods and similar), as we want to see your coding skills as much as possible :)
